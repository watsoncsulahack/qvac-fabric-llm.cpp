`qvac-fabric-llm.cpp` is a specialized fork of [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) optimized for embedded systems, mobile devices, and enterprise deployment scenarios. It extends the excellent foundation of llama.cpp with additional capabilities focused on low-bit KV-cache quantization, mobile GPU optimization, and flexible integration patterns.


## Key Features

The following capabilities are developed and maintained as part of qvac-fabric-llm.cpp. Features marked as *exclusive* are not available in upstream llama.cpp.

### TurboQuant KV Cache Quantization *(exclusive)*

TurboQuant adds low-bit KV-cache quantization formats for long-context inference while preserving token-generation quality close to higher-bit caches. It supports:

- **TBQ3_0 / TBQ4_0**: TurboQuant 3-bit and 4-bit formats with QJL Stage 2 correction.
- **PQ3_0 / PQ4_0**: PolarQuant 3-bit and 4-bit Stage 1-only formats.
- **64-wide variants**: `tbq3_0_64`, `tbq4_0_64`, `pq3_0_64`, and `pq4_0_64` for models with smaller attention head dimensions.
- **Backend support**: CPU quantization/dequantization and Vulkan inference kernels, including attention paths and mixed K/V cache configurations. CUDA and Metal do not include TurboQuant kernels in this release.
- **Test coverage**: performance coverage via [test-kv-cache-quantization-perf.sh](tests/test-kv-cache-quantization-perf.sh), perplexity coverage via [test-kv-cache-quantization-perp.sh](tests/test-kv-cache-quantization-perp.sh), and eval coverage via [test-kv-cache-ruler.py](tests/test-kv-cache-ruler.py), [test-kv-cache-niah.py](tests/test-kv-cache-niah.py), [test-kv-cache-longbench.py](tests/test-kv-cache-longbench.py), [test-kv-cache-zeroscrolls.py](tests/test-kv-cache-zeroscrolls.py), and [test-kv-cache-leval.py](tests/test-kv-cache-leval.py).

Quality checks on Qwen3.5-4B Q8_0 show `tbq4_0/pq4_0` at -0.03% perplexity delta versus `f16/f16`, with 94.8% RULER main score and 37.04 LongBench average versus 37.52 for `f16/f16`. See the full [TurboQuant benchmark report](docs/turboquant-benchmarks.md) for all measured models, contexts, and quality results.

### LoRA Fine-Tuning *(exclusive)*

`qvac-fabric-llm.cpp` provides native [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning across CPU, Vulkan, and Metal backends. The training pipeline runs directly on consumer hardware, including mobile phones and integrated GPUs.

- Multi-backend GPU training (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple, Mali, Adreno)
- FP32, FP16, Q8, and Q4 training paths
- Supervised instruction-tuning via assistant-only masked loss (SFT)
- Checkpoint saving and resumable training
- Learning rate schedulers (constant, cosine, linear) with warmup support
- LoRA adapter merging into base models via **llama-export-lora**
- Verified compatibility with Qwen3 and Gemma3 model architectures

For usage details and CLI reference, see the [Finetuning Guide](examples/training/README.md).

### BitNet Inference and Fine-Tuning *(exclusive)*

Native support for [BitNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764) ternary quantized models via the TQ2_0 data type, enabling efficient inference and LoRA fine-tuning of models such as [bitnet_b1_58-xl](https://huggingface.co/gianni-cor/bitnet_b1_58-xl-TQ2_0) on resource-constrained devices.

The official [microsoft/BitNet](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet) inference framework provides optimized CPU kernels and GPU support limited to CUDA. `qvac-fabric-llm.cpp` **extends** BitNet to all major GPU backends -- Vulkan, Metal, and CPU -- bringing cross-platform GPU-accelerated BitNet inference and on-device fine-tuning to hardware not covered by the upstream framework, including Apple Silicon, mobile GPUs (Adreno, Mali), and AMD/Intel discrete GPUs. Compatible with models such as [bitnet_b1_58-3B](https://huggingface.co/1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-3B).

- **Backends**: Vulkan, Metal and CPU TQ2_0 quantization support
- **Training**: LoRA fine-tuning of BitNet models on Vulkan, Metal, and CPU backends
- **Conversion**: HuggingFace-to-GGUF conversion for BitNet model architectures
- Cooperative matrix (coopmat) support for Vulkan devices that expose the extension

### Mobile GPU Optimization *(exclusive)*

Enhanced GPU support with targeted optimizations for Qualcomm Adreno GPUs.

- **Vulkan on Adreno 800+**: quantized inference (Q4_0, Q8) and LoRA fine-tuning for Gemma3, Qwen3, and BitNet (TQ2_0) model architectures.
- **OpenCL on Adreno**: inference support for all other model architectures.
- Adreno-specific Vulkan shader variants for improved throughput.
- Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA) integration for efficient GPU memory management.
