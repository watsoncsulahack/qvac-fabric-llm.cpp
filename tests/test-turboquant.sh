#   tests/test-turboquant.sh [--short|--full] [build_dir]
#
# Modes (only affects the subgroup-coverage legs; the fns / perf / backend-ops
# legs always run their full matrix because they're quick):
#   --short   (default) The SG-coverage legs (native Vulkan + the 3 lavapipe
#             stitch legs) only test tbq3_0 + pq3_0 + their _64 siblings, not
#             every type. Cuts runtime of the slow legs by ~50% while still
#             exercising both QUANT_K = 128 (tbq3_0 / pq3_0) and QUANT_K = 64
#             (tbq3_0_64 / pq3_0_64) code paths, which is the dimension the
#             stitch logic actually varies over. Picked for CI / quick local
#             iteration.
#   --full    All 8 TBQ/PQ types (tbq3/tbq4/pq3/pq4 + each _64) on every leg.
#             Use before landing shader changes to the cooperative path.

# Stitch-path coverage via lavapipe. The generalized copy_to_quant shader

#   * NSG >  1 -> shared-memory stitch path reduces across NSG subgroups.
#
# On the vast majority of real GPUs the native subgroup size is >= 32, which

#   * NVIDIA: subgroupSize is fixed at 32 on every generation. Pass.
#   * AMD RDNA (desktop / APU, e.g. any gfx10xx/11xx): native 32 or 64,
#     minSubgroupSize >= 32. Pass.
#   * AMD GCN / CDNA (older / datacenter): native 64, no smaller sizes. Pass.
#   * Apple / most mobile ARM Mali, Qualcomm Adreno in desktop-ish modes:
#     also >= 32. Pass.
# VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control on these devices cannot request SG < 32 because
# minSubgroupSize is >= 32, so the first leg above necessarily exercises NSG=1
# only. That's fine for production (the real hardware never needs the stitch)
# but means NSG > 1 is unreachable from real GPUs in CI.
#
# lavapipe (Mesa llvmpipe's Vulkan driver) closes this gap. It is a CPU-side
# software implementation whose native subgroup size equals
# LP_NATIVE_VECTOR_WIDTH / 32 (one lane per 32-bit slot in the JIT'd SIMD
# vector, SG range is clamped to that single value). Sweeping
# LP_NATIVE_VECTOR_WIDTH over its three supported values yields every
# non-trivial NSG the shader supports:

#   -----------------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------
